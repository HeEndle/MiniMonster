# MiniMonster
Script for [Spike2](https://ced.co.uk/products/spkovin) to analyze patch-clamp data.

## Installation
This script is developed for [Spike2 v10](https://ced.co.uk/products/spike2history/10). It should be compatible with [Spike2 v6](https://ced.co.uk/products/spike2history/6) or higher, however compatibility with these older versions is not tested.  
Copy the scipt folder in any directory and open the **MiniMonster.s2s** file using Spike2.

## Quick Guide
- Run the script either with a data file open or open a file when prompted.
- Select the channel you want to analyze when prompted (you can only analyze one channel at a time currently).
- Place the cursors left and right of a section of you signal that does **NOT** contain any of the peaks you want to analyze to estimate signal background levels.
- adjust settings to your liking and press "OK" (the script will automatically load the last used configuration).
- Make changes during manual review if desired.
- Output is generated in the textwindow to the left and can be saved to disk.
